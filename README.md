 Currently continuing work on a solo game project as I fill out my portfolio and look for work. Learning GAS now in Unreal Engine, and wow is it a game changer. I've started using AngelScript for programming UE and it's pretty great! Trying to find ideal cel shading is difficult. I'm looking into modding the engine and learning HLSL...

- ⚙️ Fluent in Unreal Blueprints and UE++ (C++). I also enjoy animation and tech art.
- ⚙️ Familiar with Python, Bash, Java, C#, and HTML/CSS. Quite rusty though.
- 🏫 I graduated with an AAS in Game & Simulation Development: Programming!
- 🏫 In addition I started an AS in Computer Science last fall (2024)!
- I started programming on Arduino, Raspberry Pis, Linux, and some Android. It's been a while since I worked on those platforms.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects in UE5.
- 💬 Ask me about anything!
- 📫 How to reach me: Instagram or LinkedIn. There are links to my pages on my Github Pages site.
